## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GitHub Enterprise Cloud or GitHub Enterprise Server
- Administrative access to your GitHub organization
- Understanding of your institution's compliance requirements
- Basic knowledge of Git, CI/CD, and DevSecOps practices

### 🚀 Quick Start: Secure CI/CD Pipeline

For Java Spring Boot applications, get started with our production-ready CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Setup Self-hosted Runners**
   ```bash
   # Follow the comprehensive setup guide
   cat docs/self-hosted-runners/README.md
   
   # Configure runners with BFSI-specific labels
   # [self-hosted, bfsi-secure, bfsi-build, bfsi-deploy]
   ```

2. **Copy CI/CD Workflow**
   ```bash
   # Copy the complete pipeline to your repository
   cp .github/workflows/java-spring-boot-ci.yml /your-repo/.github/workflows/
   cp -r .github/codeql /your-repo/.github/
   cp -r .github/security /your-repo/.github/
   ```

3. **Configure Secrets Management**
   ```bash
   # Setup SOPS encryption for secure secrets
   # Follow the detailed guide:
   cat docs/security/secrets-management.md
   
   # Required GitHub repository secrets:
   # SOPS_AGE_KEY_DEV, SOPS_AGE_KEY_UAT, SOPS_AGE_KEY_PROD
   # REGISTRY_USERNAME, REGISTRY_PASSWORD, SONAR_TOKEN
   ```

4. **Enable Branch Protection**
   ```bash
   # Apply comprehensive branch protection rules
   # Templates available in:
   cat docs/compliance/branch-protection-rules.md
   ```

5. **Deploy Your First Application**
   ```bash
   # Use the NBFC Core example as a template
   cp -r examples/nbfc-core/* /your-repo/
   # Customize pom.xml and application.yml for your needs
   ```
