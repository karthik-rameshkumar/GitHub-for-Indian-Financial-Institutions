## üéØ Overview

This repository accelerates DevSecOps adoption for Indian financial institutions by providing:

- **Secure CI/CD Pipelines**: Pre-configured workflows for Java Spring Boot applications
- **Compliance Frameworks**: Templates aligned with RBI and IRDAI guidelines
- **Self-Hosted Runner Setup**: Secure, on-premises execution environments
- **Security Scanning**: Integrated CodeQL, dependency, and vulnerability scanning
- **Secrets Management**: Best practices for handling sensitive data
- **Branch Protection**: Templates for enforcing code review and approval workflows
- **Environment Promotion**: Controlled deployment across dev ‚Üí UAT ‚Üí production

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karthik-rameshkumar/GitHub-for-Indian-Financial-Institutions.git
   cd GitHub-for-Indian-Financial-Institutions
   ```

2. **Choose your implementation**:
   - For new Java Spring Boot projects: Use our [CI/CD Pipeline Templates](.github/workflows/)
   - For existing projects: Adapt our [Security Scanning Examples](docs/security-scanning.md)
   - For compliance setup: Follow our [Governance Guide](docs/governance.md)

3. **Configure secrets**: See [Secrets Management Guide](docs/secrets-management.md)

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipelines

Our CI/CD pipelines are designed for financial institutions with strict security and compliance requirements:

### Java Spring Boot Pipeline Features
- **Multi-stage builds** with security scanning at each stage
- **Automated testing** with coverage reporting
- **Compliance checks** for RBI/IRDAI requirements
- **Secure artifact management** with signing and verification
- **Environment-specific deployments** with approval gates

### Pipeline Templates
- [Basic Spring Boot CI/CD](.github/workflows/spring-boot-ci.yml)
- [Production Deployment Pipeline](.github/workflows/production-deploy.yml)
- [Security-focused Pipeline](.github/workflows/security-pipeline.yml)

## üîí Security & Compliance

### Integrated Security Tools
