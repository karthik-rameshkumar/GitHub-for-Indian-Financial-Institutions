## Best Practices

### Security
1. **Secrets Management**: Use SOPS for sensitive data encryption
2. **Image Scanning**: Scan all container images for vulnerabilities
3. **Network Isolation**: Use separate networks for different environments
4. **Access Control**: Implement role-based access for workflows
5. **Audit Logging**: Enable comprehensive audit trails

### Compliance
1. **Regular Audits**: Schedule automated compliance checks
2. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date compliance documentation
3. **Change Management**: Follow approval workflows for all changes
4. **Risk Assessment**: Conduct regular risk assessments
5. **Incident Response**: Maintain incident response procedures

### Performance
1. **Caching**: Use action caching for dependencies and build artifacts
2. **Parallel Execution**: Run independent jobs in parallel
3. **Resource Optimization**: Optimize runner resource usage
4. **Build Optimization**: Use multi-stage Docker builds
5. **Test Optimization**: Run fast tests first, slow tests later

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Workflow Failures
```bash
# Check workflow run logs
gh run list --repo your-org/your-repo
gh run view [run-id] --log

# Debug failed jobs
gh run view [run-id] --job [job-id]
```

#### Self-hosted Runner Issues
```bash
# Check runner status
sudo systemctl status github-runner

# View runner logs
journalctl -u github-runner -f

# Restart runner service
sudo systemctl restart github-runner
```

#### Security Scan Failures
```bash
# Check CodeQL results
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/code-scanning/alerts

# Review dependency check report
cat target/dependency-check-report.html
```
